<p>Welcome to <span class="font-semibold">Rechifi</span>. Your compass in the vast world of chifi audio.</p>
<br />
<p>We know that navigating through audio equipment is hard, especially in the chinese market. But let's be honest with ourselves. We love <span class="font-semibold">Chifi</span>. 
    This phenomenon has gained popularity due to the combination of low prices and high performance offered by these products. 
    More and more companies have managed to produce competitive audio gear that rivals established Western brands in quality but at a fraction of the cost.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The goal of this site is to provide users a tool to filter and find the audio gear based on their <span class="font-semibold">preferences</span>, and mainly to aggregate user reviews to extract common features of 
        particular product reviewed by many different users.</p> <br />
    <p>We use <span class="font-semibold">AI</span> to extract various features from users' posts and display it on gear's info page. For now the only feature we extract is <span class="font-semibold">Sound Signature</span> for In ear monitors, but we plan to add other.</p>

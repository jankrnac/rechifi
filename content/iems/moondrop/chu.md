title: Moondrop Chu

description: For over three years, the Spaceship hasbeen widely praised for its light design, comfortable fit, and superb sound performance. As a worthy successor to the Spaceship, the Chu has adopted a completely different design concept, a more traditional Chinese styling, and significantly upgraded acoustic architecture. Adopting the Aria’s decentralized dynamic structure, the high-performance 10mm composite cavity with high-frequency phased waveguide leverages a N52 Nd magnet internal magnetic circuit and 0.035m ultra-thin imported CCAW sound coil to obtain high energy conversion efficiency, and deliver outstanding performance with full dynamic range and rich details.

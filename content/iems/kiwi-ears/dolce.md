title: Kiwi Ears Dolce

description: Named after the Italian musical term for "sweet," the Dolce lives up to its name with a delightful and balanced sound profile. Its subbass extends well, delivering powerful bass kicks and full bass guitar notes in the lows. The mids have been carefully tuned to carry a slight warmth, enhancing the musicality and overall listening experience. The treble, perfectly aligned with the human ear's resonance at 3kHz, gradually decays with upper treble progression, resulting in a natural timbre in the highs. One standout feature is the LDP diaphragm, enabling one of the most natural presentations of upper treble reproduction among dynamic drivers. The treble is fully present without any harshness or shrillness.
